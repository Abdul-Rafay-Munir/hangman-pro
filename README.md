# Hangman-Pro 🎯

A web-based Hangman game built with React — a fun way to practice letters guessing, UI logic and maybe styling.  

## 🚀 What is Hangman-Pro

Hangman-Pro is a digital version of the classic Hangman word-guessing game.  
Players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. Wrong guesses bring the hangman drawing closer to completion — guess the word before you run out of attempts!  

## 📦 Tech Stack (or Used Tools)

- **JavaScript** (or TypeScript, if used) — core logic  
- **React** — UI components and state management (or whichever framework you used)  
- **HTML & CSS** — markup and styling  
- Optionally: styling frameworks, custom hooks, or additional libraries  

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started (Local Development)
